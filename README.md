<h1> To Do List </h1>

 ### 
<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a simple To Do List app in Java, which consists of 3 classes: Main, Task, TaskManager.


1. **Main**:
This class contains the main method where the application starts. It provides a console interface for users to interact with the to-do list functionalities like viewing tasks, adding tasks, editing tasks, and deleting tasks.



2. **Task**: 
  This class represents a single task in the to-do list. It has fields for task name, due date, and completion status. It also has methods to get and set these fields, as well as a toString() method for printing task details.

2. **TaskManager**:
This class manages the tasks in the to-do list. It contains methods for getting tasks, adding tasks, editing tasks, and deleting tasks. Each method interacts with the tasks list, which stores instances of the Task class.
